 advisor_GER_alexander_dobrindt_desc:0 "Bavarian CSU member Alexander Dobrindt is a loyal follower of party kingpin Horst Seehofer, serving as Secretary-General under Seehofer's chairmanship from 2009 to 2013. Since 2013, Dobrindt serves in federal politics as Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. His most notable project is the so-called 'PkW-Maut', a road toll on Germany's autobahn system which is famous for its lack of a general speed limit, making it a path of transportation of choice for both Germans and foreigners alike. Dobrindt's road toll was aimed at all drivers, but Germans would be refunded through a cut to their car tax - causing concern in other countries that this might be a breach of European Union codes of law."

 advisor_GER_alexander_gauland_desc:0 "Potentially one of the most conservative politicians in Germany still on the democratic spectrum, Alexander Eberhard Gauland is a noted right-wing hardliner, even within the right-wing hardline party that is the Alternative for Germany. Born in 1941, Gauland was an experienced lawyer and journalist before entering politics in 2010 when Angela Merkel flip-flopped on a public promise to not financially aid the Greek government. Gauland became one of the three leading co-founders of the Election Alternative 2013, which ended up becoming the AfD. Whereas the other two, Konrad Adam and Bernd Lucke, were closer to the neo-liberal spectrum, Alexander Gauland was the leader of a national conservative school of thought within the AfD and would eventually find an ally in Frauke Petry. The two ended up eliminating Bernd Lucke in an internal power struggle, with Petry taking party leadership and Gauland becoming federal spokesman. Gauland's and Petry's faction ended up securing lots of popular support, with the AfD scoring as high as 24% of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt. In Gauland's home state Brandenburg, the result was still a considerable 12.2%. Gauland continues to guide AfD policy from behind the scenes, notably protecting controversial orator Björn Höcke from many inner-party consequences for Höcke's pro-nazi speeches."

Angela Merkel would be elected the 8th Federal Chancellor - and the first woman to hold that position - of Germany in 2005 and defend that position in 2009 and 2013. Merkel is noted as a believer in realpolitik approaches to national and international issues, conflicts and disputes.

While the Princeton graduate and former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and White House Chief of Staff is respected for many of his accomplishments, his part in the American response to the September 11 terrorist attacks makes his legacy a controversial one, with many people pointing to him as the mastermind behind wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq and as a pioneer of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' - or, as these methods might be more commonly known, state-authorized torture."

A long-time expert on foreign policy, he served as a long-time member and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. His votes in the senate on US foreign policy have been cause of debate, with Biden opposing the 1991 Gulf War, but voting in favor of the 1994/95 Bosnian Intervention and even the Iraq War in 2002, before turning around again and then opposing George W. Bush's 2007 plan to once again increase the number of American troops in the Middle East and in Iraq especially. After having sought the Democratic Nomination for President unsuccessfully in 1988 and in 2008, Biden became Barack Obama's running mate against the Republican McCain/Palin ticket, with the Democrats winning the election quite clearly. As Vice President, both his negotiation skill with House Republicans - finding compromises on the 2010 Job Creation Act and the 2011 Budget Control Act, among others - and his interest in veteran affairs were notable. Both the end of his long vice presidency and the death of his eldest son Joseph 'Beau' Robinette III made Biden take a break from politics, instead joining the University of Pennsylvania in a political and diplomatic institute."

He got 685,000 votes in 1996 and 2.8 million votes in 2000, with the fact that he probably served as a spoiler candidate making George W.
