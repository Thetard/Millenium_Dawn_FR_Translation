 italy.28.t:0 "Criminals sabotage our industries!"
 italy.28.d:0 "Earlier today we received news that our industries and infrastructures were sabotages by heavily equipped criminals. The industries were set on fire and huge explosions happened on highways. Our secret agencies discovered that the attacks are an answer from the feared leaders of the 'Mafia' who didn't take our recent actions against them lightly."

Italy is now Mafia-free, no longer will our population, especially in southern Italy, suffer because of them."
 italy.32.o1:0 "This is a historical day for Italy!"
