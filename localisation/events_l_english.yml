By 2010, opinion polls routinely suggested that Labor would not be able to win the next election if it continued on this path. According to ABC's 7:30 Report', the seeds for Gillard to challenge candidate Rudd were sown by "Victorian Right factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten MP and Senator David Feeney, who had between them secured the support of "New South Wales power broker" Mark Arbib. Feeney and Arbib discussed the matter of a potential leadership challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and began a numbers count to establish the feasibility of a leadership challenge. The pair found that there was more than enough support for Gillard for the challenge to proceed. The declining ratings for both the Labor Party and Rudd personally were attributed to many factors, including problems with the Home Insulation Program, a significant delay to a planned carbon emissions reduction scheme, a move to introduce mandatory internet filtering, the proposed introduction of the Resource Super Profits Tax, and the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. Senior Labor MPs conceded that the ALP's primary vote had dropped below 30% in some key marginal seats, a figure which if replicated at a federal election would have seen a Labor defeat."

By February 2012, it was suggested by some journalists that Rudd himself had been giving 'background briefings' in his office to the press. Several senior ministers, including Simon Crean, reacted to this by openly accusing Rudd of disloyalty, demanding that Gillard sack him.

A number of senior ministers spoke to the press later that evening attacking Rudd, while Bruce Hawker and Senator Doug Cameron gave interviews supporting Rudd.

Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at doorstops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down. Later in March, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals—called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher—Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns". On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm AEDST that afternoon.

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

Earlier in the year the ALP caucus approved changes to the way the federal parliamentary leader is chosen. The new rules make it more difficult to change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. The new rules encourage the parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership. The new rules are controversial, however, and have been publicly criticised by ALP Senator Stephen Conroy and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Nominations opened at a parliamentary party meeting on Friday 13 September 2013, and remained open for a week. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten formally nominated.

After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us'. Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the 'narrow margin' of the vote left the party Leader 'deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation'.

[TUR.GetLeader], on vacation at the time, called upon his supporters to resist via social media and had informed them that he evaded capture.\n\nTurkey's government is still in power, but there will need to be serious repercussions - but the opposition warns the ruling [TUR.GetRulingParty] to not abuse their influence in this position of power. However, there will need to be some sort of vengeance for the more than 300 killed during the battles in the night.\n\n[TUR.GetLeader] has already found the culprit though - he has repeatedly pointed to exiled islamic preacher Fetullah Gülen, living abroad in the United States.

After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical Southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"

In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."

The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed.
